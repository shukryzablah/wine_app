IX. 
 
THE TEST. 
 
I can wade grief, 
Whole pools of it, -- 
I 'm used to that. 
But the least push of joy 
Breaks up my feet, 
And I tip -- drunken. 
Let no pebble smile, 
'T was the new liquor, -- 
That was all! 
 
Power is only pain, 
Stranded, through discipline, 
Till weights will hang. 
Give balm to giants, 
And they 'll wilt, like men. 
Give Himmaleh, -- 
They 'll carry him!
