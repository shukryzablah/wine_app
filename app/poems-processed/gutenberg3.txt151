THE SUN'S WOOING. 
 
The sun just touched the morning; 
The morning, happy thing, 
Supposed that he had come to dwell, 
And life would be all spring. 
 
She felt herself supremer, -- 
A raised, ethereal thing; 
Henceforth for her what holiday! 
Meanwhile, her wheeling king 
 
Trailed slow along the orchards 
His haughty, spangled hems, 
Leaving a new necessity, -- 
The want of diadems! 
 
The morning fluttered, staggered, 
Felt feebly for her crown, -- 
Her unanointed forehead 
Henceforth her only one.
