IX. 
 
APRIL. 
 
An altered look about the hills; 
A Tyrian light the village fills; 
A wider sunrise in the dawn; 
A deeper twilight on the lawn; 
A print of a vermilion foot; 
A purple finger on the slope; 
A flippant fly upon the pane; 
A spider at his trade again; 
An added strut in chanticleer; 
A flower expected everywhere; 
An axe shrill singing in the woods; 
Fern-odors on untravelled roads, -- 
All this, and more I cannot tell, 
A furtive look you know as well, 
And Nicodemus' mystery 
Receives its annual reply.
