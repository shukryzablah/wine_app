THE MOON. 
 
The moon was but a chin of gold 
  A night or two ago, 
And now she turns her perfect face 
  Upon the world below. 
 
Her forehead is of amplest blond; 
  Her cheek like beryl stone; 
Her eye unto the summer dew 
  The likest I have known. 
 
Her lips of amber never part; 
  But what must be the smile 
Upon her friend she could bestow 
  Were such her silver will! 
 
And what a privilege to be 
  But the remotest star! 
For certainly her way might pass 
  Beside your twinkling door. 
 
Her bonnet is the firmament, 
  The universe her shoe, 
The stars the trinkets at her belt, 
  Her dimities of blue.
