XVIII. 
 
THE BOOK OF MARTYRS. 
 
Read, sweet, how others strove, 
Till we are stouter; 
What they renounced, 
Till we are less afraid; 
How many times they bore 
The faithful witness, 
Till we are helped, 
As if a kingdom cared! 
 
Read then of faith 
That shone above the fagot; 
Clear strains of hymn 
The river could not drown; 
Brave names of men 
And celestial women, 
Passed out of record 
Into renown!
