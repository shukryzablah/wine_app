THE RAILWAY TRAIN. 
 
I like to see it lap the miles, 
And lick the valleys up, 
And stop to feed itself at tanks; 
And then, prodigious, step 
 
Around a pile of mountains, 
And, supercilious, peer 
In shanties by the sides of roads; 
And then a quarry pare 
 
To fit its sides, and crawl between, 
Complaining all the while 
In horrid, hooting stanza; 
Then chase itself down hill 
 
And neigh like Boanerges; 
Then, punctual as a star, 
Stop -- docile and omnipotent -- 
At its own stable door.
