Essential oils are wrung: 
The attar from the rose 
Is not expressed by suns alone, 
It is the gift of screws. 
 
The general rose decays; 
But this, in lady's drawer, 
Makes summer when the lady lies 
In ceaseless rosemary. 
 
 
 
 
XXVI. 
 
I lived on dread; to those who know 
The stimulus there is 
In danger, other impetus 
Is numb and vital-less. 
 
As 't were a spur upon the soul, 
A fear will urge it where 
To go without the spectre's aid 
Were challenging despair.
