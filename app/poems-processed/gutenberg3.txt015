XV. 
 
THE BEE. 
 
Like trains of cars on tracks of plush 
I hear the level bee: 
A jar across the flowers goes, 
Their velvet masonry 
 
Withstands until the sweet assault 
Their chivalry consumes, 
While he, victorious, tilts away 
To vanquish other blooms. 
 
His feet are shod with gauze, 
His helmet is of gold; 
His breast, a single onyx 
With chrysoprase, inlaid. 
 
His labor is a chant, 
His idleness a tune; 
Oh, for a bee's experience 
Of clovers and of noon!
