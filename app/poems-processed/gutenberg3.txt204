IX. 
 
THE BATTLE-FIELD. 
 
They dropped like flakes, they dropped like stars, 
   Like petals from a rose, 
When suddenly across the June 
   A wind with fingers goes. 
 
They perished in the seamless grass, -- 
   No eye could find the place; 
But God on his repealless list 
   Can summon every face.
