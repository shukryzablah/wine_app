XI. 
 
MY ROSE. 
 
Pigmy seraphs gone astray, 
Velvet people from Vevay, 
Belles from some lost summer day, 
Bees' exclusive coterie. 
Paris could not lay the fold 
Belted down with emerald; 
Venice could not show a cheek 
Of a tint so lustrous meek. 
Never such an ambuscade 
As of brier and leaf displayed 
For my little damask maid. 
I had rather wear her grace 
Than an earl's distinguished face; 
I had rather dwell like her 
Than be Duke of Exeter 
Royalty enough for me 
To subdue the bumble-bee!
