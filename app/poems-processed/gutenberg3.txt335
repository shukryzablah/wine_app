XXIII. 
 
THE BALLOON. 
 
You've seen balloons set, haven't you? 
  So stately they ascend 
It is as swans discarded you 
  For duties diamond. 
 
Their liquid feet go softly out 
  Upon a sea of blond; 
They spurn the air as 't were too mean 
  For creatures so renowned. 
 
Their ribbons just beyond the eye, 
  They struggle some for breath, 
And yet the crowd applauds below; 
  They would not encore death. 
 
The gilded creature strains and spins, 
  Trips frantic in a tree, 
Tears open her imperial veins 
  And tumbles in the sea. 
 
The crowd retire with an oath 
  The dust in streets goes down, 
And clerks in counting-rooms observe, 
  ''T was only a balloon.'
