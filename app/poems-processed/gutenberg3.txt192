XLVIII. 
 
FRINGED GENTIAN. 
 
God made a little gentian; 
It tried to be a rose 
And failed, and all the summer laughed. 
But just before the snows 
There came a purple creature 
That ravished all the hill; 
And summer hid her forehead, 
And mockery was still. 
The frosts were her condition; 
The Tyrian would not come 
Until the North evoked it. 
"Creator! shall I bloom?"
