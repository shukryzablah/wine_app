I. 
 
SUCCESS. 
 
[Published in "A Masque of Poets" 
at the request of "H.H.," the author's 
fellow-townswoman and friend.] 
 
Success is counted sweetest 
By those who ne'er succeed. 
To comprehend a nectar 
Requires sorest need. 
 
Not one of all the purple host 
Who took the flag to-day 
Can tell the definition, 
So clear, of victory, 
 
As he, defeated, dying, 
On whose forbidden ear 
The distant strains of triumph 
Break, agonized and clear!
