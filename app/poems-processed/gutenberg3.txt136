VI. 
 
The way I read a letter 's this: 
'T is first I lock the door, 
And push it with my fingers next, 
For transport it be sure. 
 
And then I go the furthest off 
To counteract a knock; 
Then draw my little letter forth 
And softly pick its lock. 
 
Then, glancing narrow at the wall, 
And narrow at the floor, 
For firm conviction of a mouse 
Not exorcised before, 
 
Peruse how infinite I am 
To -- no one that you know! 
And sigh for lack of heaven, -- but not 
The heaven the creeds bestow.
