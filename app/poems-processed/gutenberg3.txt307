Not with a club the heart is broken, 
    Nor with a stone; 
A whip, so small you could not see it. 
    I've known 
 
To lash the magic creature 
    Till it fell, 
Yet that whip's name too noble 
    Then to tell. 
 
Magnanimous of bird 
    By boy descried, 
To sing unto the stone 
    Of which it died.
