SURRENDER. 
 
Doubt me, my dim companion! 
Why, God would be content 
With but a fraction of the love 
Poured thee without a stint. 
The whole of me, forever, 
What more the woman can, -- 
Say quick, that I may dower thee 
With last delight I own! 
 
It cannot be my spirit, 
For that was thine before; 
I ceded all of dust I knew, -- 
What opulence the more 
Had I, a humble maiden, 
Whose farthest of degree 
Was that she might, 
Some distant heaven, 
Dwell timidly with thee!
