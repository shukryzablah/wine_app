XLIV. 
 
The bone that has no marrow; 
  What ultimate for that? 
It is not fit for table, 
  For beggar, or for cat. 
 
A bone has obligations, 
  A being has the same; 
A marrowless assembly 
  Is culpabler than shame. 
 
But how shall finished creatures 
  A function fresh obtain? -- 
Old Nicodemus' phantom 
  Confronting us again!
