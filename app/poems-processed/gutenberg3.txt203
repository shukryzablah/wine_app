VIII. 
 
I have not told my garden yet, 
Lest that should conquer me; 
I have not quite the strength now 
To break it to the bee. 
 
I will not name it in the street, 
For shops would stare, that I, 
So shy, so very ignorant, 
Should have the face to die. 
 
The hillsides must not know it, 
Where I have rambled so, 
Nor tell the loving forests 
The day that I shall go, 
 
Nor lisp it at the table, 
Nor heedless by the way 
Hint that within the riddle 
One will walk to-day!
