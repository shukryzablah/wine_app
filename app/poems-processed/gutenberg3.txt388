XLVIII. 
 
There's been a death in the opposite house 
  As lately as to-day. 
I know it by the numb look 
  Such houses have alway. 
 
The neighbors rustle in and out, 
  The doctor drives away. 
A window opens like a pod, 
  Abrupt, mechanically; 
 
Somebody flings a mattress out, -- 
  The children hurry by; 
They wonder if It died on that, -- 
  I used to when a boy. 
 
The minister goes stiffly in 
  As if the house were his, 
And he owned all the mourners now, 
  And little boys besides; 
 
And then the milliner, and the man 
  Of the appalling trade, 
To take the measure of the house. 
  There'll be that dark parade 
 
Of tassels and of coaches soon; 
  It's easy as a sign, -- 
The intuition of the news 
  In just a country town.
