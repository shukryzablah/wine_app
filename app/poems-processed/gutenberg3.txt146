XVI. 
 
What if I say I shall not wait? 
What if I burst the fleshly gate 
And pass, escaped, to thee? 
What if I file this mortal off, 
See where it hurt me, -- that 's enough, -- 
And wade in liberty? 
 
They cannot take us any more, -- 
Dungeons may call, and guns implore; 
Unmeaning now, to me, 
As laughter was an hour ago, 
Or laces, or a travelling show, 
Or who died yesterday!
