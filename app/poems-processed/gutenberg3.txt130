LVII. 
 
CALLED BACK. 
 
Just lost when I was saved! 
Just felt the world go by! 
Just girt me for the onset with eternity, 
When breath blew back, 
And on the other side 
I heard recede the disappointed tide! 
 
Therefore, as one returned, I feel, 
Odd secrets of the line to tell! 
Some sailor, skirting foreign shores, 
Some pale reporter from the awful doors 
Before the seal! 
 
Next time, to stay! 
Next time, the things to see 
By ear unheard, 
Unscrutinized by eye. 
 
Next time, to tarry, 
While the ages steal, -- 
Slow tramp the centuries, 
And the cycles wheel.
