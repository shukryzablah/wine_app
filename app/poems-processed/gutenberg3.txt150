IV. 
 
DAY'S PARLOR. 
 
The day came slow, till five o'clock, 
Then sprang before the hills 
Like hindered rubies, or the light 
A sudden musket spills. 
 
The purple could not keep the east, 
The sunrise shook from fold, 
Like breadths of topaz, packed a night, 
The lady just unrolled. 
 
The happy winds their timbrels took; 
The birds, in docile rows, 
Arranged themselves around their prince 
(The wind is prince of those). 
 
The orchard sparkled like a Jew, -- 
How mighty 't was, to stay 
A guest in this stupendous place, 
The parlor of the day!
