II. 
 
LOVE'S HUMILITY. 
 
My worthiness is all my doubt, 
  His merit all my fear, 
Contrasting which, my qualities 
  Do lowlier appear; 
 
Lest I should insufficient prove 
  For his beloved need, 
The chiefest apprehension 
  Within my loving creed. 
 
So I, the undivine abode 
  Of his elect content, 
Conform my soul as 't were a church 
  Unto her sacrament.
