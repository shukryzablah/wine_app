VII. 
 
THE WHITE HEAT. 
 
Dare you see a soul at the white heat? 
   Then crouch within the door. 
Red is the fire's common tint; 
   But when the vivid ore 
 
Has sated flame's conditions, 
   Its quivering substance plays 
Without a color but the light 
   Of unanointed blaze. 
 
Least village boasts its blacksmith, 
   Whose anvil's even din 
Stands symbol for the finer forge 
   That soundless tugs within, 
 
Refining these impatient ores 
   With hammer and with blaze, 
Until the designated light 
   Repudiate the forge.
