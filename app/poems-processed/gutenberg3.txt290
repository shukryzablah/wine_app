THANKSGIVING DAY. 
 
One day is there of the series 
  Termed Thanksgiving day, 
Celebrated part at table, 
  Part in memory. 
 
Neither patriarch nor pussy, 
  I dissect the play; 
Seems it, to my hooded thinking, 
  Reflex holiday. 
 
Had there been no sharp subtraction 
  From the early sum, 
Not an acre or a caption 
  Where was once a room, 
 
Not a mention, whose small pebble 
  Wrinkled any bay, -- 
Unto such, were such assembly, 
  'T were Thanksgiving day.
