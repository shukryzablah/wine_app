XII. 
 
How dare the robins sing, 
  When men and women hear 
Who since they went to their account 
  Have settled with the year! -- 
Paid all that life had earned 
  In one consummate bill, 
And now, what life or death can do 
  Is immaterial. 
Insulting is the sun 
  To him whose mortal light, 
Beguiled of immortality, 
  Bequeaths him to the night. 
In deference to him 
  Extinct be every hum, 
Whose garden wrestles with the dew, 
  At daybreak overcome!
