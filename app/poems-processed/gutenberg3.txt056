XXV. 
 
DYING. 
 
The sun kept setting, setting still; 
No hue of afternoon 
Upon the village I perceived, -- 
From house to house 't was noon. 
 
The dusk kept dropping, dropping still; 
No dew upon the grass, 
But only on my forehead stopped, 
And wandered in my face. 
 
My feet kept drowsing, drowsing still, 
My fingers were awake; 
Yet why so little sound myself 
Unto my seeming make? 
 
How well I knew the light before! 
I could not see it now. 
'T is dying, I am doing; but 
I'm not afraid to know.
