THE SEA OF SUNSET. 
 
This is the land the sunset washes, 
These are the banks of the Yellow Sea; 
Where it rose, or whither it rushes, 
These are the western mystery! 
 
Night after night her purple traffic 
Strews the landing with opal bales; 
Merchantmen poise upon horizons, 
Dip, and vanish with fairy sails.
