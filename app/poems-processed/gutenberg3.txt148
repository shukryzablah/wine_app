II. 
 
OUT OF THE MORNING. 
 
Will there really be a morning? 
Is there such a thing as day? 
Could I see it from the mountains 
If I were as tall as they? 
 
Has it feet like water-lilies? 
Has it feathers like a bird? 
Is it brought from famous countries 
Of which I have never heard? 
 
Oh, some scholar! Oh, some sailor! 
Oh, some wise man from the skies! 
Please to tell a little pilgrim 
Where the place called morning lies!
