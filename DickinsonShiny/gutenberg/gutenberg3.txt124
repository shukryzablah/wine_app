I gained it so, 
      By climbing slow, 
By catching at the twigs that grow 
Between the bliss and me. 
      It hung so high, 
      As well the sky 
      Attempt by strategy. 
 
 
I said I gained it, -- 
      This was all. 
Look, how I clutch it, 
      Lest it fall, 
And I a pauper go; 
Unfitted by an instant's grace 
For the contented beggar's face 
I wore an hour ago.
