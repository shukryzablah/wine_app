WHY? 
 
The murmur of a bee 
A witchcraft yieldeth me. 
If any ask me why, 
'T were easier to die 
Than tell. 
 
The red upon the hill 
Taketh away my will; 
If anybody sneer, 
Take care, for God is here, 
That's all. 
 
The breaking of the day 
Addeth to my degree; 
If any ask me how, 
Artist, who drew me so, 
Must tell!
