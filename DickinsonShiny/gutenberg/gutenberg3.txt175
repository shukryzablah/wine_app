XXIX. 
 
The one that could repeat the summer day 
Were greater than itself, though he 
Minutest of mankind might be. 
And who could reproduce the sun, 
At period of going down -- 
The lingering and the stain, I mean -- 
When Orient has been outgrown, 
And Occident becomes unknown, 
His name remain.
