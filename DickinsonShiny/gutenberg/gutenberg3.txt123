HUNGER. 
 
I had been hungry all the years; 
My noon had come, to dine; 
I, trembling, drew the table near, 
And touched the curious wine. 
 
'T was this on tables I had seen, 
When turning, hungry, lone, 
I looked in windows, for the wealth 
I could not hope to own. 
 
I did not know the ample bread, 
'T was so unlike the crumb 
The birds and I had often shared 
In Nature's dining-room. 
 
The plenty hurt me, 't was so new, -- 
Myself felt ill and odd, 
As berry of a mountain bush 
Transplanted to the road. 
 
Nor was I hungry; so I found 
That hunger was a way 
Of persons outside windows, 
The entering takes away.
