XXVI. 
 
THE STORM. 
 
There came a wind like a bugle; 
It quivered through the grass, 
And a green chill upon the heat 
So ominous did pass 
We barred the windows and the doors 
As from an emerald ghost; 
The doom's electric moccason 
That very instant passed. 
On a strange mob of panting trees, 
And fences fled away, 
And rivers where the houses ran 
The living looked that day. 
The bell within the steeple wild 
The flying tidings whirled. 
How much can come 
And much can go, 
And yet abide the world!
