XXXIII. 
 
SIMPLICITY. 
 
How happy is the little stone 
That rambles in the road alone, 
And doesn't care about careers, 
And exigencies never fears; 
Whose coat of elemental brown 
A passing universe put on; 
And independent as the sun, 
Associates or glows alone, 
Fulfilling absolute decree 
In casual simplicity.
