I. 
 
NATURE'S CHANGES. 
 
The springtime's pallid landscape 
  Will glow like bright bouquet, 
Though drifted deep in parian 
  The village lies to-day. 
 
The lilacs, bending many a year, 
  With purple load will hang; 
The bees will not forget the tune 
  Their old forefathers sang. 
 
The rose will redden in the bog, 
  The aster on the hill 
Her everlasting fashion set, 
  And covenant gentians frill, 
 
Till summer folds her miracle 
  As women do their gown, 
Or priests adjust the symbols 
  When sacrament is done.
