I read my sentence steadily, 
Reviewed it with my eyes, 
To see that I made no mistake 
In its extremest clause, -- 
 
The date, and manner of the shame; 
And then the pious form 
That "God have mercy" on the soul 
The jury voted him. 
 
I made my soul familiar 
With her extremity, 
That at the last it should not be 
A novel agony, 
 
But she and Death, acquainted, 
Meet tranquilly as friends, 
Salute and pass without a hint -- 
And there the matter ends.
