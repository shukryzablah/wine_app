XXIV. 
 
Afraid? Of whom am I afraid? 
Not death; for who is he? 
The porter of my father's lodge 
As much abasheth me. 
 
Of life? 'T were odd I fear a thing 
That comprehendeth me 
In one or more existences 
At Deity's decree. 
 
Of resurrection? Is the east 
Afraid to trust the morn 
With her fastidious forehead? 
As soon impeach my crown!
