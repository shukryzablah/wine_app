VII. 
 
THE BUTTERFLY'S DAY. 
 
From cocoon forth a butterfly 
As lady from her door 
Emerged -- a summer afternoon -- 
Repairing everywhere, 
 
Without design, that I could trace, 
Except to stray abroad 
On miscellaneous enterprise 
The clovers understood. 
 
Her pretty parasol was seen 
Contracting in a field 
Where men made hay, then struggling hard 
With an opposing cloud, 
 
Where parties, phantom as herself, 
To Nowhere seemed to go 
In purposeless circumference, 
As 't were a tropic show. 
 
And notwithstanding bee that worked, 
And flower that zealous blew, 
This audience of idleness 
Disdained them, from the sky, 
 
Till sundown crept, a steady tide, 
And men that made the hay, 
And afternoon, and butterfly, 
Extinguished in its sea.
