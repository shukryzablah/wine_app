We cover thee, sweet face. 
  Not that we tire of thee, 
But that thyself fatigue of us; 
  Remember, as thou flee, 
We follow thee until 
  Thou notice us no more, 
And then, reluctant, turn away 
  To con thee o'er and o'er, 
And blame the scanty love 
  We were content to show, 
Augmented, sweet, a hundred fold 
  If thou would'st take it now.
