The moon is distant from the sea, 
And yet with amber hands 
She leads him, docile as a boy, 
Along appointed sands. 
 
He never misses a degree; 
Obedient to her eye, 
He comes just so far toward the town, 
Just so far goes away. 
 
Oh, Signor, thine the amber hand, 
And mine the distant sea, -- 
Obedient to the least command 
Thine eyes impose on me.
