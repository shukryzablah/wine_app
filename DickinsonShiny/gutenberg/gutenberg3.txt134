IV. 
 
THE CONTRACT. 
 
I gave myself to him, 
And took himself for pay. 
The solemn contract of a life 
Was ratified this way. 
 
The wealth might disappoint, 
Myself a poorer prove 
Than this great purchaser suspect, 
The daily own of Love 
 
Depreciate the vision; 
But, till the merchant buy, 
Still fable, in the isles of spice, 
The subtle cargoes lie. 
 
At least, 't is mutual risk, -- 
Some found it mutual gain; 
Sweet debt of Life, -- each night to owe, 
Insolvent, every noon.
