XXX. 
 
THE WlND'S VISIT. 
 
The wind tapped like a tired man, 
And like a host, "Come in," 
I boldly answered; entered then 
My residence within 
 
A rapid, footless guest, 
To offer whom a chair 
Were as impossible as hand 
A sofa to the air. 
 
No bone had he to bind him, 
His speech was like the push 
Of numerous humming-birds at once 
From a superior bush. 
 
His countenance a billow, 
His fingers, if he pass, 
Let go a music, as of tunes 
Blown tremulous in glass. 
 
He visited, still flitting; 
Then, like a timid man, 
Again he tapped -- 't was flurriedly -- 
And I became alone.
