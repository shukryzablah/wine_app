XI. 
 
THE LOVERS. 
 
The rose did caper on her cheek, 
Her bodice rose and fell, 
Her pretty speech, like drunken men, 
Did stagger pitiful. 
 
Her fingers fumbled at her work, -- 
Her needle would not go; 
What ailed so smart a little maid 
It puzzled me to know, 
 
Till opposite I spied a cheek 
That bore another rose; 
Just opposite, another speech 
That like the drunkard goes; 
 
A vest that, like the bodice, danced 
To the immortal tune, -- 
Till those two troubled little clocks 
Ticked softly into one.
