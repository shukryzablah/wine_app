 
VI. 
 
THE ROBIN. 
 
The robin is the one 
That interrupts the morn 
With hurried, few, express reports 
When March is scarcely on. 
 
The robin is the one 
That overflows the noon 
With her cherubic quantity, 
An April but begun. 
 
The robin is the one 
That speechless from her nest 
Submits that home and certainty 
And sanctity are best.
