XVIII. 
 
THE SPIRIT. 
 
'T is whiter than an Indian pipe, 
  'T is dimmer than a lace; 
No stature has it, like a fog, 
  When you approach the place. 
 
Not any voice denotes it here, 
  Or intimates it there; 
A spirit, how doth it accost? 
  What customs hath the air? 
 
This limitless hyperbole 
  Each one of us shall be; 
'T is drama, if (hypothesis) 
  It be not tragedy!
