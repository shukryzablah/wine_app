XVIII. 
 
TWO VOYAGERS. 
 
Two butterflies went out at noon 
And waltzed above a stream, 
Then stepped straight through the firmament 
And rested on a beam; 
 
And then together bore away 
Upon a shining sea, -- 
Though never yet, in any port, 
Their coming mentioned be. 
 
If spoken by the distant bird, 
If met in ether sea 
By frigate or by merchantman, 
Report was not to me.
