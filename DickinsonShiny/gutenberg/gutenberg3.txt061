XXX. 
 
Except to heaven, she is nought; 
Except for angels, lone; 
Except to some wide-wandering bee, 
A flower superfluous blown; 
 
Except for winds, provincial; 
Except by butterflies, 
Unnoticed as a single dew 
That on the acre lies. 
 
The smallest housewife in the grass, 
Yet take her from the lawn, 
And somebody has lost the face 
That made existence home!
