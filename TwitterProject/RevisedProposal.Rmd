**Team Name:** YZ Analytics

**Title:** Another Glass, Please: Creating a Virtual Sommelier

**Purpose:** 

**Data:** We will be working with Kaggle's wine review data, found here: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews (Thoutt, 2017)

**Variables:**

Variable descriptions from the data set:

country - The country that the wine is from
description - A few sentences from a sommelier describing the wine's taste, smell, look, feel, etc.
designation - The vineyard within the winery where the grapes that made the wine are from
points - The number of points WineEnthusiast rated the wine on a scale of 1-100 (though they say they only post reviews for wines that score >=80)
price - The cost for a bottle of the wine
province - The province or state that the wine is from
region_1 - The wine growing area in a province or state (ie Napa)
region_2 - Sometimes there are more specific regions specified within a wine growing area (ie Rutherford inside the Napa Valley), but this value can sometimes be blank
variety - The type of grapes used to make the wine (ie Pinot Noir)
winery - The winery that made the wine

**Model:** Our model aims to predict price? quality?

**End Product:** We aim to demo our analyses online with dynamic visualizations. Virtual Sommelier - Interactive map that provides wine recommendations?
