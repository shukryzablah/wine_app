**1. Have you already collected and ingested all of the data that you will need in order to complete your project? If not, please estimate the percentage of the data that you have, describe any issues that you are having, and what your plan is for getting the rest of the data.**

We wanted to incorporate new features from the text data and geocode the wineries. We have successfully geocoded most of the wineries and we have computed the tfidf scores for the words in all the descriptions. We are at a stage where we want to join back the information from the tfidf into the original data. 

Estimate 85%.

**2. Do you have any questions for me?**

None
