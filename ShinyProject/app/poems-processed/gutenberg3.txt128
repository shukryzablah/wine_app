LV. 
 
I know that he exists 
Somewhere, in silence. 
He has hid his rare life 
From our gross eyes. 
 
'T is an instant's play, 
'T is a fond ambush, 
Just to make bliss 
Earn her own surprise! 
 
But should the play 
Prove piercing earnest, 
Should the glee glaze 
In death's stiff stare, 
 
Would not the fun 
Look too expensive? 
Would not the jest 
Have crawled too far?
