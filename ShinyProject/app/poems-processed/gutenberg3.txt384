XLIV. 
 
If I may have it when it's dead 
  I will contented be; 
If just as soon as breath is out 
  It shall belong to me, 
 
Until they lock it in the grave, 
  'T is bliss I cannot weigh, 
For though they lock thee in the grave, 
  Myself can hold the key. 
 
Think of it, lover! I and thee 
  Permitted face to face to be; 
After a life, a death we'll say, -- 
  For death was that, and this is thee.
