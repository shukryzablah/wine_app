XXXII. 
 
GONE. 
 
Went up a year this evening! 
I recollect it well! 
Amid no bells nor bravos 
The bystanders will tell! 
Cheerful, as to the village, 
Tranquil, as to repose, 
Chastened, as to the chapel, 
This humble tourist rose. 
Did not talk of returning, 
Alluded to no time 
When, were the gales propitious, 
We might look for him; 
Was grateful for the roses 
In life's diverse bouquet, 
Talked softly of new species 
To pick another day. 
 
Beguiling thus the wonder, 
The wondrous nearer drew; 
Hands bustled at the moorings -- 
The crowd respectful grew. 
Ascended from our vision 
To countenances new! 
A difference, a daisy, 
Is all the rest I knew!
