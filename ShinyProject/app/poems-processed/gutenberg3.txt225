XXXI. 
 
PRECEDENCE. 
 
Wait till the majesty of Death 
Invests so mean a brow! 
Almost a powdered footman 
Might dare to touch it now! 
 
Wait till in everlasting robes 
This democrat is dressed, 
Then prate about "preferment" 
And "station" and the rest! 
 
Around this quiet courtier 
Obsequious angels wait! 
Full royal is his retinue, 
Full purple is his state! 
 
A lord might dare to lift the hat 
To such a modest clay, 
Since that my Lord, "the Lord of lords" 
Receives unblushingly!
