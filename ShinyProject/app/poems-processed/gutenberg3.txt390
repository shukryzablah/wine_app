Water is taught by thirst; 
Land, by the oceans passed; 
  Transport, by throe; 
Peace, by its battles told; 
Love, by memorial mould; 
  Birds, by the snow. 
 
 
 
 
LII. 
 
THIRST. 
 
We thirst at first, -- 't is Nature's act; 
  And later, when we die, 
A little water supplicate 
  Of fingers going by. 
 
It intimates the finer want, 
  Whose adequate supply 
Is that great water in the west 
  Termed immortality.
