THE HEMLOCK. 
 
I think the hemlock likes to stand 
Upon a marge of snow; 
It suits his own austerity, 
And satisfies an awe 
 
That men must slake in wilderness, 
Or in the desert cloy, -- 
An instinct for the hoar, the bald, 
Lapland's necessity. 
 
The hemlock's nature thrives on cold; 
The gnash of northern winds 
Is sweetest nutriment to him, 
His best Norwegian wines. 
 
To satin races he is nought; 
But children on the Don 
Beneath his tabernacles play, 
And Dnieper wrestlers run.
