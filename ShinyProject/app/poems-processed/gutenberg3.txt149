At half-past three a single bird 
Unto a silent sky 
Propounded but a single term 
Of cautious melody. 
 
At half-past four, experiment 
Had subjugated test, 
And lo! her silver principle 
Supplanted all the rest. 
 
At half-past seven, element 
Nor implement was seen, 
And place was where the presence was, 
Circumference between.
