XLVI. 
 
Heart not so heavy as mine, 
Wending late home, 
As it passed my window 
Whistled itself a tune, -- 
 
A careless snatch, a ballad, 
A ditty of the street; 
Yet to my irritated ear 
An anodyne so sweet, 
 
It was as if a bobolink, 
Sauntering this way, 
Carolled and mused and carolled, 
Then bubbled slow away. 
 
It was as if a chirping brook 
Upon a toilsome way 
Set bleeding feet to minuets 
Without the knowing why. 
 
To-morrow, night will come again, 
Weary, perhaps, and sore. 
Ah, bugle, by my window, 
I pray you stroll once more!
