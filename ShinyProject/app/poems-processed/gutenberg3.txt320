VIII. 
 
A murmur in the trees to note, 
  Not loud enough for wind; 
A star not far enough to seek, 
  Nor near enough to find; 
 
A long, long yellow on the lawn, 
  A hubbub as of feet; 
Not audible, as ours to us, 
  But dapperer, more sweet; 
 
A hurrying home of little men 
  To houses unperceived, -- 
All this, and more, if I should tell, 
  Would never be believed. 
 
Of robins in the trundle bed 
  How many I espy 
Whose nightgowns could not hide the wings, 
  Although I heard them try! 
 
But then I promised ne'er to tell; 
  How could I break my word? 
So go your way and I'll go mine, -- 
  No fear you'll miss the road.
