XX. 
 
The last night that she lived, 
It was a common night, 
Except the dying; this to us 
Made nature different. 
 
We noticed smallest things, -- 
Things overlooked before, 
By this great light upon our minds 
Italicized, as 't were. 
 
That others could exist 
While she must finish quite, 
A jealousy for her arose 
So nearly infinite. 
 
We waited while she passed; 
It was a narrow time, 
Too jostled were our souls to speak, 
At length the notice came. 
 
She mentioned, and forgot; 
Then lightly as a reed 
Bent to the water, shivered scarce, 
Consented, and was dead. 
 
And we, we placed the hair, 
And drew the head erect; 
And then an awful leisure was, 
Our faith to regulate.
