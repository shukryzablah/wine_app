XXVI. 
 
Victory comes late, 
And is held low to freezing lips 
Too rapt with frost 
To take it. 
How sweet it would have tasted, 
Just a drop! 
Was God so economical? 
His table 's spread too high for us 
Unless we dine on tip-toe. 
Crumbs fit such little mouths, 
Cherries suit robins; 
The eagle's golden breakfast 
Strangles them. 
God keeps his oath to sparrows, 
Who of little love 
Know how to starve!
