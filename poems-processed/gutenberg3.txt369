XXIX. 
 
TRYING TO FORGET. 
 
Bereaved of all, I went abroad, 
  No less bereaved to be 
Upon a new peninsula, -- 
  The grave preceded me, 
 
Obtained my lodgings ere myself, 
  And when I sought my bed, 
The grave it was, reposed upon 
  The pillow for my head. 
 
I waked, to find it first awake, 
  I rose, -- it followed me; 
I tried to drop it in the crowd, 
  To lose it in the sea, 
 
In cups of artificial drowse 
  To sleep its shape away, -- 
The grave was finished, but the spade 
  Remained in memory.
