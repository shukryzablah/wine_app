XXXIII. 
 
ALONG THE POTOMAC. 
 
When I was small, a woman died. 
To-day her only boy 
Went up from the Potomac, 
His face all victory, 
 
To look at her; how slowly 
The seasons must have turned 
Till bullets clipt an angle, 
And he passed quickly round! 
 
If pride shall be in Paradise 
I never can decide; 
Of their imperial conduct, 
No person testified. 
 
But proud in apparition, 
That woman and her boy 
Pass back and forth before my brain, 
As ever in the sky.
