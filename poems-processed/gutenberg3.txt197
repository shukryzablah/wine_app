II. 
 
Going to heaven! 
I don't know when, 
Pray do not ask me how, -- 
Indeed, I 'm too astonished 
To think of answering you! 
Going to heaven! -- 
How dim it sounds! 
And yet it will be done 
As sure as flocks go home at night 
Unto the shepherd's arm! 
 
Perhaps you 're going too! 
Who knows? 
If you should get there first, 
Save just a little place for me 
Close to the two I lost! 
 
The smallest "robe" will fit me, 
And just a bit of "crown;" 
For you know we do not mind our dress 
When we are going home. 
 
I 'm glad I don't believe it, 
For it would stop my breath, 
And I 'd like to look a little more 
At such a curious earth! 
I am glad they did believe it 
Whom I have never found 
Since the mighty autumn afternoon 
I left them in the ground.
