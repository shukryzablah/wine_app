XXIV. 
 
TOO MUCH. 
 
I should have been too glad, I see, 
Too lifted for the scant degree 
   Of life's penurious round; 
My little circuit would have shamed 
This new circumference, have blamed 
   The homelier time behind. 
 
I should have been too saved, I see, 
Too rescued; fear too dim to me 
   That I could spell the prayer 
I knew so perfect yesterday, -- 
That scalding one, "Sabachthani," 
   Recited fluent here. 
 
Earth would have been too much, I see, 
And heaven not enough for me; 
   I should have had the joy 
Without the fear to justify, -- 
The palm without the Calvary; 
   So, Saviour, crucify. 
 
Defeat whets victory, they say; 
The reefs in old Gethsemane 
   Endear the shore beyond. 
'T is beggars banquets best define; 
'T is thirsting vitalizes wine, -- 
   Faith faints to understand.
