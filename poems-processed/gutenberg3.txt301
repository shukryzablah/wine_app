FORGOTTEN. 
 
There is a word 
  Which bears a sword 
  Can pierce an armed man. 
It hurls its barbed syllables,-- 
  At once is mute again. 
But where it fell 
The saved will tell 
  On patriotic day, 
Some epauletted brother 
  Gave his breath away. 
 
Wherever runs the breathless sun, 
  Wherever roams the day, 
There is its noiseless onset, 
  There is its victory! 
 
Behold the keenest marksman! 
  The most accomplished shot! 
Time's sublimest target 
  Is a soul 'forgot'!
