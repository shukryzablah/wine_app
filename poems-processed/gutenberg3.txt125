LII. 
 
To learn the transport by the pain, 
As blind men learn the sun; 
To die of thirst, suspecting 
That brooks in meadows run; 
 
To stay the homesick, homesick feet 
Upon a foreign shore 
Haunted by native lands, the while, 
And blue, beloved air -- 
 
This is the sovereign anguish, 
This, the signal woe! 
These are the patient laureates 
Whose voices, trained below, 
 
Ascend in ceaseless carol, 
Inaudible, indeed, 
To us, the duller scholars 
Of the mysterious bard!
