SECRETS. 
 
The skies can't keep their secret! 
They tell it to the hills -- 
The hills just tell the orchards -- 
And they the daffodils! 
 
A bird, by chance, that goes that way 
Soft overheard the whole. 
If I should bribe the little bird, 
Who knows but she would tell? 
 
I think I won't, however, 
It's finer not to know; 
If summer were an axiom, 
What sorcery had snow? 
 
So keep your secret, Father! 
I would not, if I could, 
Know what the sapphire fellows do, 
In your new-fashioned world!
