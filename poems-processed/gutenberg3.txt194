THE SNOW. 
 
It sifts from leaden sieves, 
It powders all the wood, 
It fills with alabaster wool 
The wrinkles of the road. 
 
It makes an even face 
Of mountain and of plain, -- 
Unbroken forehead from the east 
Unto the east again. 
 
It reaches to the fence, 
It wraps it, rail by rail, 
Till it is lost in fleeces; 
It flings a crystal veil 
 
On stump and stack and stem, -- 
The summer's empty room, 
Acres of seams where harvests were, 
Recordless, but for them. 
 
It ruffles wrists of posts, 
As ankles of a queen, -- 
Then stills its artisans like ghosts, 
Denying they have been.
