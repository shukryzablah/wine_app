DEATH. 
 
Death is like the insect 
  Menacing the tree, 
Competent to kill it, 
  But decoyed may be. 
 
Bait it with the balsam, 
  Seek it with the knife, 
Baffle, if it cost you 
  Everything in life. 
 
Then, if it have burrowed 
  Out of reach of skill, 
Ring the tree and leave it, -- 
  'T is the vermin's will.
