I meant to find her when I came; 
  Death had the same design; 
But the success was his, it seems, 
  And the discomfit mine.

  For just this single time; 
But Death had told her so the first, 
  And she had hearkened him. 
 
To wander now is my abode; 
  To rest, -- to rest would be 
A privilege of hurricane 
  To memory and me.
