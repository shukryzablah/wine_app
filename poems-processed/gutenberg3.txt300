IX. 
 
  Poor little heart! 
  Did they forget thee? 
Then dinna care! Then dinna care! 
 
  Proud little heart! 
  Did they forsake thee? 
Be debonair! Be debonair! 
 
  Frail little heart! 
  I would not break thee: 
Could'st credit me? Could'st credit me? 
 
  Gay little heart! 
  Like morning glory 
Thou'll wilted be; thou'll wilted be!
