VIII. 
 
AT HOME. 
 
The night was wide, and furnished scant 
With but a single star, 
That often as a cloud it met 
Blew out itself for fear. 
 
The wind pursued the little bush, 
And drove away the leaves 
November left; then clambered up 
And fretted in the eaves. 
 
No squirrel went abroad; 
A dog's belated feet 
Like intermittent plush were heard 
Adown the empty street. 
 
To feel if blinds be fast, 
And closer to the fire 
Her little rocking-chair to draw, 
And shiver for the poor, 
 
The housewife's gentle task. 
"How pleasanter," said she 
Unto the sofa opposite, 
"The sleet than May -- no thee!"
