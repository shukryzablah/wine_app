He put the belt around my life, -- 
I heard the buckle snap, 
And turned away, imperial, 
My lifetime folding up 
Deliberate, as a duke would do 
A kingdom's title-deed, -- 
Henceforth a dedicated sort, 
A member of the cloud. 
 
Yet not too far to come at call, 
And do the little toils 
That make the circuit of the rest, 
And deal occasional smiles 
To lives that stoop to notice mine 
And kindly ask it in, -- 
Whose invitation, knew you not 
For whom I must decline?
