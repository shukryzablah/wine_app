TRIUMPH. 
 
Triumph may be of several kinds. 
There 's triumph in the room 
When that old imperator, Death, 
By faith is overcome. 
 
There 's triumph of the finer mind 
When truth, affronted long, 
Advances calm to her supreme, 
Her God her only throng. 
 
A triumph when temptation's bribe 
Is slowly handed back, 
One eye upon the heaven renounced 
And one upon the rack. 
 
Severer triumph, by himself 
Experienced, who can pass 
Acquitted from that naked bar, 
Jehovah's countenance!
