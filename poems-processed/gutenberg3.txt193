XLIX. 
 
NOVEMBER. 
 
Besides the autumn poets sing, 
A few prosaic days 
A little this side of the snow 
And that side of the haze. 
 
A few incisive mornings, 
A few ascetic eyes, -- 
Gone Mr. Bryant's golden-rod, 
And Mr. Thomson's sheaves. 
 
Still is the bustle in the brook, 
Sealed are the spicy valves; 
Mesmeric fingers softly touch 
The eyes of many elves. 
 
Perhaps a squirrel may remain, 
My sentiments to share. 
Grant me, O Lord, a sunny mind, 
Thy windy will to bear!
