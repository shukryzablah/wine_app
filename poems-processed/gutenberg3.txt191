XLVII. 
 
SUMMER'S OBSEQUIES. 
 
The gentian weaves her fringes, 
The maple's loom is red. 
My departing blossoms 
Obviate parade. 
 
A brief, but patient illness, 
An hour to prepare; 
And one, below this morning, 
Is where the angels are. 
 
It was a short procession, -- 
The bobolink was there, 
An aged bee addressed us, 
And then we knelt in prayer. 
 
We trust that she was willing, -- 
We ask that we may be. 
Summer, sister, seraph, 
Let us go with thee! 
 
In the name of the bee 
And of the butterfly 
And of the breeze, amen!
