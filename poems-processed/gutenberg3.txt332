Could I but ride indefinite, 
  As doth the meadow-bee, 
And visit only where I liked, 
  And no man visit me, 
 
And flirt all day with buttercups, 
  And marry whom I may, 
And dwell a little everywhere, 
  Or better, run away 
 
With no police to follow, 
  Or chase me if I do, 
Till I should jump peninsulas 
  To get away from you, -- 
 
I said, but just to be a bee 
  Upon a raft of air, 
And row in nowhere all day long, 
  And anchor off the bar,-- 
What liberty! So captives deem 
  Who tight in dungeons are.
