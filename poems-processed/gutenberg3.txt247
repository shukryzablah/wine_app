XI. 
 
If the foolish call them 'flowers,' 
  Need the wiser tell? 
If the savans 'classify' them, 
  It is just as well! 
 
Those who read the Revelations 
  Must not criticise 
Those who read the same edition 
  With beclouded eyes! 
 
Could we stand with that old Moses 
  Canaan denied, -- 
Scan, like him, the stately landscape 
  On the other side, -- 
 
Doubtless we should deem superfluous 
  Many sciences 
Not pursued by learn√®d angels 
  In scholastic skies! 
 
Low amid that glad _Belles lettres_ 
  Grant that we may stand, 
Stars, amid profound Galaxies, 
  At that grand 'Right hand'!
