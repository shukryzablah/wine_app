XXIV. 
 
THE WIND. 
 
Of all the sounds despatched abroad, 
There's not a charge to me 
Like that old measure in the boughs, 
That phraseless melody 
 
The wind does, working like a hand 
Whose fingers brush the sky, 
Then quiver down, with tufts of tune 
Permitted gods and me. 
 
When winds go round and round in bands, 
And thrum upon the door, 
And birds take places overhead, 
To bear them orchestra, 
 
I crave him grace, of summer boughs, 
If such an outcast be, 
He never heard that fleshless chant 
Rise solemn in the tree, 
 
As if some caravan of sound 
On deserts, in the sky, 
Had broken rank, 
Then knit, and passed 
In seamless company.
