XLVIII. 
 
Unto my books so good to turn 
Far ends of tired days; 
It half endears the abstinence, 
And pain is missed in praise. 
 
As flavors cheer retarded guests 
With banquetings to be, 
So spices stimulate the time 
Till my small library. 
 
It may be wilderness without, 
Far feet of failing men, 
But holiday excludes the night, 
And it is bells within. 
 
I thank these kinsmen of the shelf; 
Their countenances bland 
Enamour in prospective, 
And satisfy, obtained.
