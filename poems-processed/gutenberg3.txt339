XXVIII. 
 
THE COMING OF NIGHT. 
 
How the old mountains drip with sunset, 
  And the brake of dun! 
How the hemlocks are tipped in tinsel 
  By the wizard sun! 
 
How the old steeples hand the scarlet, 
  Till the ball is full, -- 
Have I the lip of the flamingo 
  That I dare to tell? 
 
Then, how the fire ebbs like billows, 
  Touching all the grass 
With a departing, sapphire feature, 
  As if a duchess pass! 
 
How a small dusk crawls on the village 
  Till the houses blot; 
And the odd flambeaux no men carry 
  Glimmer on the spot! 
 
Now it is night in nest and kennel, 
  And where was the wood, 
Just a dome of abyss is nodding 
  Into solitude! -- 
 
These are the visions baffled Guido; 
  Titian never told; 
Domenichino dropped the pencil, 
  Powerless to unfold.
