FOLLOWING. 
 
I had no cause to be awake, 
My best was gone to sleep, 
And morn a new politeness took, 
And failed to wake them up, 
 
But called the others clear, 
And passed their curtains by. 
Sweet morning, when I over-sleep, 
Knock, recollect, for me! 
 
I looked at sunrise once, 
And then I looked at them, 
And wishfulness in me arose 
For circumstance the same. 
 
'T was such an ample peace, 
It could not hold a sigh, -- 
'T was Sabbath with the bells divorced, 
'T was sunset all the day. 
 
So choosing but a gown 
And taking but a prayer, 
The only raiment I should need, 
I struggled, and was there.
