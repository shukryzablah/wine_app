XXXIV. 
 
Superfluous were the sun 
  When excellence is dead; 
He were superfluous every day, 
  For every day is said 
 
That syllable whose faith 
  Just saves it from despair, 
And whose 'I'll meet you' hesitates 
  If love inquire, 'Where?' 
 
Upon his dateless fame 
  Our periods may lie, 
As stars that drop anonymous 
  From an abundant sky.
