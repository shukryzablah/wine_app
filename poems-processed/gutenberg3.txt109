XXXVI. 
 
SIGHT. 
 
Before I got my eye put out, 
I liked as well to see 
As other creatures that have eyes, 
And know no other way. 
 
But were it told to me, to-day, 
That I might have the sky 
For mine, I tell you that my heart 
Would split, for size of me. 
 
The meadows mine, the mountains mine, -- 
All forests, stintless stars, 
As much of noon as I could take 
Between my finite eyes. 
 
The motions of the dipping birds, 
The lightning's jointed road, 
For mine to look at when I liked, -- 
The news would strike me dead! 
 
So safer, guess, with just my soul 
Upon the window-pane 
Where other creatures put their eyes, 
Incautious of the sun.
