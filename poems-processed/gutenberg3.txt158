THE ORIOLE'S SECRET. 
 
To hear an oriole sing 
May be a common thing, 
Or only a divine. 
 
It is not of the bird 
Who sings the same, unheard, 
As unto crowd. 
 
The fashion of the ear 
Attireth that it hear 
In dun or fair. 
 
So whether it be rune, 
Or whether it be none, 
Is of within; 
 
The "tune is in the tree," 
The sceptic showeth me; 
"No, sir! In thee!"
