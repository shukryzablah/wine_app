XXXVIII. 
 
DEAD. 
 
There's something quieter than sleep 
  Within this inner room! 
It wears a sprig upon its breast, 
  And will not tell its name. 
 
Some touch it and some kiss it, 
  Some chafe its idle hand; 
It has a simple gravity 
  I do not understand! 
 
While simple-hearted neighbors 
  Chat of the 'early dead,' 
We, prone to periphrasis, 
  Remark that birds have fled!
