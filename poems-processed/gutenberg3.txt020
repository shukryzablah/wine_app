XX. 
 
TWO WORLDS. 
 
It makes no difference abroad, 
The seasons fit the same, 
The mornings blossom into noons, 
And split their pods of flame. 
 
Wild-flowers kindle in the woods, 
The brooks brag all the day; 
No blackbird bates his jargoning 
For passing Calvary. 
 
Auto-da-fe and judgment 
Are nothing to the bee; 
His separation from his rose 
To him seems misery.
