XXVI. 
 
The farthest thunder that I heard 
  Was nearer than the sky, 
And rumbles still, though torrid noons 
  Have lain their missiles by. 
The lightning that preceded it 
  Struck no one but myself, 
But I would not exchange the bolt 
  For all the rest of life. 
Indebtedness to oxygen 
  The chemist may repay, 
But not the obligation 
  To electricity. 
It founds the homes and decks the days, 
  And every clamor bright 
Is but the gleam concomitant 
  Of that waylaying light. 
The thought is quiet as a flake, -- 
  A crash without a sound; 
How life's reverberation 
  Its explanation found!
