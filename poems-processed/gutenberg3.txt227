XXXIII. 
 
REQUIEM. 
 
Taken from men this morning, 
Carried by men to-day, 
Met by the gods with banners 
Who marshalled her away. 
 
One little maid from playmates, 
One little mind from school, -- 
There must be guests in Eden; 
All the rooms are full. 
 
Far as the east from even, 
Dim as the border star, -- 
Courtiers quaint, in kingdoms, 
Our departed are.
