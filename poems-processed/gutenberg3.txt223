XXIX. 
 
GHOSTS. 
 
One need not be a chamber to be haunted, 
One need not be a house; 
The brain has corridors surpassing 
Material place. 
 
Far safer, of a midnight meeting 
External ghost, 
Than an interior confronting 
That whiter host. 
 
Far safer through an Abbey gallop, 
The stones achase, 
Than, moonless, one's own self encounter 
In lonesome place. 
 
Ourself, behind ourself concealed, 
Should startle most; 
Assassin, hid in our apartment, 
Be horror's least. 
 
The prudent carries a revolver, 
He bolts the door, 
O'erlooking a superior spectre 
More near.
