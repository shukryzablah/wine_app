To know just how he suffered would be dear; 
To know if any human eyes were near 
To whom he could intrust his wavering gaze, 
Until it settled firm on Paradise. 
 
To know if he was patient, part content, 
Was dying as he thought, or different; 
Was it a pleasant day to die, 
And did the sunshine face his way? 
 
What was his furthest mind, of home, or God, 
Or what the distant say 
At news that he ceased human nature 
On such a day? 
 
And wishes, had he any? 
Just his sigh, accented, 
Had been legible to me. 
And was he confident until 
Ill fluttered out in everlasting well? 
 
And if he spoke, what name was best, 
What first, 
What one broke off with 
At the drowsiest? 
 
Was he afraid, or tranquil? 
Might he know 
How conscious consciousness could grow, 
Till love that was, and love too blest to be, 
Meet -- and the junction be Eternity?
