XLVII. 
 
What soft, cherubic creatures 
  These gentlewomen are! 
One would as soon assault a plush 
  Or violate a star. 
 
Such dimity convictions, 
  A horror so refined 
Of freckled human nature, 
  Of Deity ashamed, -- 
 
It's such a common glory, 
  A fisherman's degree! 
Redemption, brittle lady, 
  Be so, ashamed of thee.
