 
IV. TIME AND ETERNITY. 
 
I. 
 
This world is not conclusion; 
  A sequel stands beyond, 
Invisible, as music, 
  But positive, as sound. 
It beckons and it baffles; 
  Philosophies don't know, 
And through a riddle, at the last, 
  Sagacity must go. 
To guess it puzzles scholars; 
  To gain it, men have shown 
Contempt of generations, 
  And crucifixion known.
