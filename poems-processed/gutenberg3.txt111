XXXVIII. 
 
THE PREACHER. 
 
He preached upon "breadth" till it argued him narrow, -- 
The broad are too broad to define; 
And of "truth" until it proclaimed him a liar, -- 
The truth never flaunted a sign. 
 
Simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence 
As gold the pyrites would shun. 
What confusion would cover the innocent Jesus 
To meet so enabled a man!
