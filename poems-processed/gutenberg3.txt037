VI. 
 
FROM THE CHRYSALIS. 
 
My cocoon tightens, colors tease, 
I'm feeling for the air; 
A dim capacity for wings 
Degrades the dress I wear. 
 
A power of butterfly must be 
The aptitude to fly, 
Meadows of majesty concedes 
And easy sweeps of sky. 
 
So I must baffle at the hint 
And cipher at the sign, 
And make much blunder, if at last 
I take the clew divine.
