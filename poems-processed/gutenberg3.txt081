VIII. 
 
TRIUMPHANT. 
 
Who never lost, are unprepared 
A coronet to find; 
Who never thirsted, flagons 
And cooling tamarind. 
 
Who never climbed the weary league -- 
Can such a foot explore 
The purple territories 
On Pizarro's shore? 
 
How many legions overcome? 
The emperor will say. 
How many colors taken 
On Revolution Day? 
 
How many bullets bearest? 
The royal scar hast thou? 
Angels, write "Promoted" 
On this soldier's brow!
