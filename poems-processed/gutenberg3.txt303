XII. 
 
THE MASTER. 
 
He fumbles at your spirit 
  As players at the keys 
Before they drop full music on; 
  He stuns you by degrees, 
 
Prepares your brittle substance 
  For the ethereal blow, 
By fainter hammers, further heard, 
  Then nearer, then so slow 
 
Your breath has time to straighten, 
  Your brain to bubble cool, -- 
Deals one imperial thunderbolt 
  That scalps your naked soul.
