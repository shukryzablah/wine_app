XXXIV. 
 
I have a king who does not speak; 
So, wondering, thro' the hours meek 
  I trudge the day away,-- 
Half glad when it is night and sleep, 
If, haply, thro' a dream to peep 
  In parlors shut by day. 
 
And if I do, when morning comes, 
It is as if a hundred drums 
  Did round my pillow roll, 
And shouts fill all my childish sky, 
And bells keep saying 'victory' 
  From steeples in my soul! 
 
And if I don't, the little Bird 
Within the Orchard is not heard, 
  And I omit to pray, 
'Father, thy will be done' to-day, 
For my will goes the other way, 
  And it were perjury!
