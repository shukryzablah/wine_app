Three weeks passed since I had seen her, -- 
  Some disease had vexed; 
'T was with text and village singing 
  I beheld her next, 
 
And a company -- our pleasure 
  To discourse alone; 
Gracious now to me as any, 
  Gracious unto none. 
 
Borne, without dissent of either, 
  To the parish night; 
Of the separated people 
  Which are out of sight?
