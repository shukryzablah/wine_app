XXV. 
 
SHIPWRECK. 
 
It tossed and tossed, -- 
A little brig I knew, -- 
O'ertook by blast, 
It spun and spun, 
And groped delirious, for morn. 
 
It slipped and slipped, 
As one that drunken stepped; 
Its white foot tripped, 
Then dropped from sight. 
 
Ah, brig, good-night 
To crew and you; 
The ocean's heart too smooth, too blue, 
To break for you.
