NUMEN LUMEN. 
 
I live with him, I see his face; 
  I go no more away 
For visitor, or sundown; 
  Death's single privacy, 
 
The only one forestalling mine, 
  And that by right that he 
Presents a claim invisible, 
  No wedlock granted me. 
 
I live with him, I hear his voice, 
  I stand alive to-day 
To witness to the certainty 
  Of immortality 
 
Taught me by Time, -- the lower way, 
  Conviction every day, -- 
That life like this is endless, 
  Be judgment what it may.
