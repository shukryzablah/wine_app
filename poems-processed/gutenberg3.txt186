She sweeps with many-colored brooms, 
And leaves the shreds behind; 
Oh, housewife in the evening west, 
Come back, and dust the pond! 
 
You dropped a purple ravelling in, 
You dropped an amber thread; 
And now you 've littered all the East 
With duds of emerald! 
 
And still she plies her spotted brooms, 
And still the aprons fly, 
Till brooms fade softly into stars -- 
And then I come away.
