XXXIII. 
 
GRIEFS. 
 
I measure every grief I meet 
  With analytic eyes; 
I wonder if it weighs like mine, 
  Or has an easier size. 
 
I wonder if they bore it long, 
  Or did it just begin? 
I could not tell the date of mine, 
  It feels so old a pain. 
 
I wonder if it hurts to live, 
  And if they have to try, 
And whether, could they choose between, 
  They would not rather die. 
 
I wonder if when years have piled -- 
  Some thousands -- on the cause 
Of early hurt, if such a lapse 
  Could give them any pause; 
 
Or would they go on aching still 
  Through centuries above, 
Enlightened to a larger pain 
  By contrast with the love. 
 
The grieved are many, I am told; 
  The reason deeper lies, -- 
Death is but one and comes but once, 
  And only nails the eyes. 
 
There's grief of want, and grief of cold, -- 
  A sort they call 'despair;' 
There's banishment from native eyes, 
  In sight of native air. 
 
And though I may not guess the kind 
  Correctly, yet to me 
A piercing comfort it affords 
  In passing Calvary, 
 
To note the fashions of the cross, 
  Of those that stand alone, 
Still fascinated to presume 
  That some are like my own.
