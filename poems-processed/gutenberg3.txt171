XXV. 
 
THE MUSHROOM. 
 
The mushroom is the elf of plants, 
At evening it is not; 
At morning in a truffled hut 
It stops upon a spot 
 
As if it tarried always; 
And yet its whole career 
Is shorter than a snake's delay, 
And fleeter than a tare. 
 
'T is vegetation's juggler, 
The germ of alibi; 
Doth like a bubble antedate, 
And like a bubble hie. 
 
I feel as if the grass were pleased 
To have it intermit; 
The surreptitious scion 
Of summer's circumspect. 
 
Had nature any outcast face, 
Could she a son contemn, 
Had nature an Iscariot, 
That mushroom, -- it is him.
