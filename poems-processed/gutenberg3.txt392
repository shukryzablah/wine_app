LIV. 
 
CHARLOTTE BRONTË'S GRAVE. 
 
All overgrown by cunning moss, 
  All interspersed with weed, 
The little cage of 'Currer Bell,' 
  In quiet Haworth laid. 
 
This bird, observing others, 
  When frosts too sharp became, 
Retire to other latitudes, 
  Quietly did the same, 
 
But differed in returning; 
  Since Yorkshire hills are green, 
Yet not in all the nests I meet 
  Can nightingale be seen. 
 
Gathered from many wanderings, 
  Gethsemane can tell 
Through what transporting anguish 
  She reached the asphodel! 
 
Soft fall the sounds of Eden 
  Upon her puzzled ear; 
Oh, what an afternoon for heaven, 
  When 'Brontë' entered there!
