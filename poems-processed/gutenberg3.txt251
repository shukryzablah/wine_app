THE INEVITABLE. 
 
While I was fearing it, it came, 
  But came with less of fear, 
Because that fearing it so long 
  Had almost made it dear. 
There is a fitting a dismay, 
  A fitting a despair. 
'Tis harder knowing it is due, 
  Than knowing it is here. 
The trying on the utmost, 
  The morning it is new, 
Is terribler than wearing it 
  A whole existence through.
