XVI. 
 
THE WIND. 
 
It's like the light, -- 
  A fashionless delight 
It's like the bee, -- 
  A dateless melody. 
 
It's like the woods, 
  Private like breeze, 
Phraseless, yet it stirs 
  The proudest trees. 
 
It's like the morning, -- 
  Best when it's done, -- 
The everlasting clocks 
  Chime noon.
