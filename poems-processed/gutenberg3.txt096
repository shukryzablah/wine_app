XXIII. 
 
A poor torn heart, a tattered heart, 
That sat it down to rest, 
Nor noticed that the ebbing day 
Flowed silver to the west, 
Nor noticed night did soft descend 
Nor constellation burn, 
Intent upon the vision 
Of latitudes unknown. 
 
The angels, happening that way, 
This dusty heart espied; 
Tenderly took it up from toil 
And carried it to God. 
There, -- sandals for the barefoot; 
There, -- gathered from the gales, 
Do the blue havens by the hand 
Lead the wandering sails.
