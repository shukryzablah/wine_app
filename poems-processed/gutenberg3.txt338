XXVII. 
 
AURORA. 
 
Of bronze and blaze 
  The north, to-night! 
  So adequate its forms, 
So preconcerted with itself, 
  So distant to alarms, -- 
An unconcern so sovereign 
  To universe, or me, 
It paints my simple spirit 
  With tints of majesty, 
Till I take vaster attitudes, 
  And strut upon my stem, 
Disdaining men and oxygen, 
  For arrogance of them. 
 
My splendors are menagerie; 
  But their competeless show 
Will entertain the centuries 
  When I am, long ago, 
An island in dishonored grass, 
  Whom none but daisies know.
