XXXVI. 
 
Frequently the woods are pink, 
Frequently are brown; 
Frequently the hills undress 
Behind my native town. 
 
Oft a head is crested 
I was wont to see, 
And as oft a cranny 
Where it used to be. 
 
And the earth, they tell me, 
On its axis turned, -- 
Wonderful rotation 
By but twelve performed!
